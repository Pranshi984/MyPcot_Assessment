CRUD Application README
Introduction
This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application that allows users to manage records and register using their email address and password. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. It currently does not have a backend or database, so it uses a sample data array to demonstrate functionality.

Features
User Registration: Users can register with their name, email address, password, and gender.

Record Management:

Create new records with name, description, category, and active status.
Retrieve and display a list of records.
Filter records by active or inactive status.
Search for records by name.
Edit and delete individual records.
Bulk delete multiple records.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
A web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
Node.js (for running a development server if needed).
Installation
Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Open the project directory in your code editor.
Usage
Open the index.html file in a web browser.

You will see the registration form where you can create a user account.

Use the forms provided to create, edit, and delete records.

Use the filter and search options to manage and find records.

Development
To extend the application with a backend server and a database, you will need to implement API endpoints for CRUD operations and connect to a database of your choice (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB).

Update the script.js file to make AJAX requests to your backend API endpoints.

Customization
You can customize the application's appearance by modifying the styles in the styles.css file.
Known Issues
This is a simplified example without a backend or database. For a production-ready application, you will need to implement server-side logic and data storage.

Acknowledgments
This application is a basic demonstration of CRUD functionality and can be used as a starting point for building more complex applications.
